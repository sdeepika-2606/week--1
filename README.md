# 🌱 E-Waste Generation Using ResNet50 for Sustainable Recycling Solutions

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying electronic waste (e-waste) into different categories using **ResNet50**, a deep convolutional neural network. The goal is to build an AI-driven system to automate e-waste classification from images, which helps in streamlining the recycling process and promotes sustainable waste management.

## 🗂️ Week 1 Milestone

### ✅ Improvisations Done
- Selected **ResNet50** for better accuracy with lower complexity.
- Designed a **flowchart** representing the workflow using Canva.
- Collected the e-waste dataset from Kaggle.
- Performed image preprocessing: resizing, normalization, augmentation.
- Applied transfer learning with a custom classification head.

## 🔗 Dataset Used
[Kaggle: E-Waste Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshat103/e-waste-image-dataset)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, PIL

## 📄 Output Files
- `week1_resnet50_e_waste.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code and output
- `e-waste-flowchart.png`: Flowchart of model workflow
- `sample_mobile.png`: Example image from dataset
